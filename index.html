				<h2>History of water-polo</h2>
				<p>
					Water polo began in 19th-century England as "water rugby," evolving into a structured sport with official rules in 1877. It became an Olympic sport in 1900 for men and in 2000 for women, growing into a competitive, globally recognized game.

				<h2>Rules of water-polo</h2>
				<p>
					Water polo is a team sport played in a pool, where two teams of seven players (six field players and one goalkeeper) try to score goals by throwing a ball into the opponentâ€™s net. The game consists of four quarters, typically lasting eight minutes each in professional matches. Players can only hold the ball with one hand, except the goalkeeper who may use both. Physical contact is allowed to some extent, but overly aggressive actions are penalized. When a player commits a foul, the opposing team receives a free throw, and more severe fouls can lead to exclusion for 20 seconds or longer, depending on the infraction.
